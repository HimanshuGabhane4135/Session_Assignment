                <h4>GENERAL PLUMBING</h4>
                <p>
                    When you think, “I need a plumber,” Lakeland Plumbing and Drain is here for that need. Sinks,
                    drains, faucets, water heaters, showers and tubs, floor drains, water softeners, washers and
                    dryers, sump pumps, frozen pipes, and everything in between are our forte. If you’re not sure,
                    just ask.

                </p>
                <h4>REPLACEMENTS / REPAIRS</h4>
                <p>
                    We will replace your old faucet, showerhead, sink drain, garbage disposal, you name it. Did you
                    recently install it but it doesn’t seem to be working properly? We can help with that too. We’ll
                    assess and fix leaks and back ups quickly and with precision.
                </p>

                <h4>DRAIN CLEANING SERVICE</h4>
                <p>
                    Drain backups are one of a homeowners or building manager's worst nightmares. Have us out
                    regularly to make sure your floor drains (and any drain) is clean and ready to do its job.
                </p>

                <h4>CAMERA INSPECTION</h4>
                <p>
                    Our camera inspection service allows us to troubleshoot issues as non-invasively as possible.
                    Oftentimes there’s no need to do a major demolition when we can get in there with a camera to
                    assess an issue up close.

                            or business that’s backed up, it can become a serious issue. While there are a few
                            things
                            you can try to fix the issue yourself, you might get to the point that you need to call
                            in
                            the experts. Here are a few ways to know if it’s time to call in your local drain

                            underlooked system in our homes is the plumbing. We use it many times every day and
                            expect
                            it to operate flawlessly (as it should). For the most part, these systems will do their
                            hardworking jobs and we’ll think very little of them. When there is an issue, however,
                            it
                            can wreak serious havoc on our checkbooks and lives.
