# React Auto Form
Shows an example of removing almost all of the annoying work that it takes to create forms in React. It has performance optimizations to prevent re-renders by using React Hooks and other React features:

- useCallback
- memo
- useRef

# Use
- `git clone https://github.com/DZuz14/react-auto-form.git`
- `cd react-auto-form`
- `npm i`
- `npm start`
